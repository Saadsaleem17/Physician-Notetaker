## 🔬 Technical Details

### 1. Medical NER Implementation

**Hybrid Approach:**
- **Transformer-based**: `d4data/biomedical-ner-all` for comprehensive medical entity recognition
- **Rule-based**: Pattern matching + spaCy for precise extraction
- **Combined**: Both methods work together for maximum symptom coverage

**Three Extraction Modes:**

1. **Hybrid Mode (Default)** - Best coverage
```python
ner = MedicalNER()
entities = ner.extract_medical_entities(text)
# Uses transformer + rule-based extraction
```

2. **Rule-based Only** - Precise, lightweight
```python
symptoms = ner.extract_symptoms(text, use_transformer=False)
# Uses only pattern matching and rules
```

3. **Transformer Only** - AI-powered
```python
symptoms = ner.extract_symptoms_transformer(text)
# Uses only the biomedical NER model
```

**Comparison Tool:**
```python
comparison = ner.extract_symptoms_hybrid(text)
# Returns:
# - rule_based: symptoms found by rules
# - transformer_based: symptoms found by AI
# - combined: union of both
# - rule_only: unique to rules
# - transformer_only: unique to AI
```

**Entities Extracted:**
- Symptoms (general + specialized)
- Treatments
- Diagnosis
- Prognosis
- Patient Name
- Dates

**Handling Ambiguous Data:**
- Context-based inference from surrounding sentences
- Fallback to default values for missing information
- Multiple extraction strategies with confidence scoring
- Conservative approach to prevent hallucination

**Models Used:**
- `d4data/biomedical-ner-all` - Transformer-based medical NER (266MB)

### Q5: Training NLP model for SOAP format?

**Approaches:**

**1. Sequence-to-Sequence (Recommended):**
```python
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, T5Tokenizer

# Fine-tune T5 on transcript → SOAP pairs
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("t5-base")
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base")

# Input: "summarize medical: [transcript]"
# Output: SOAP formatted note
```

**2. Multi-task Learning:**
- Train separate classifiers for S/O/A/P sections
- Combine outputs into structured note

**3. Template-based (Current):**
- Fast, interpretable, no training needed
